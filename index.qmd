![xkcd: Elementary Physics Paths](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/elementary_physics_paths.png)

From [xkcd.com](https://www.xkcd.com/2933/)

## Course Description

A formal treatment of quantum theory using Dirac notation, including an introduction to approximation methods and their applications. The general theory of angular momentum and time-independent perturbation theory are developed and used to derive the fine and hyperfine structures of hydrogen. Additional topics may include quantum statistics, quantum dynamics, and time-dependent perturbation theory. 

## Prerequisites

PHYS 308
